This ratio can be calculated for each year to assess the company's leverage and financial risk.\\n- Return on invested capital: Net income divided by invested capital. This ratio can be calculated for each year to evaluate the company's profitability and efficiency in generating returns from its investments.\\n\\nRisks:\\n- The increasing total debt may indicate higher financial risk for the company, as it may have to allocate more resources towards debt servicing.\\n- The company's reliance on short-term investments for cash may expose it to market volatility and liquidity risks.\\n\\nOverall outlook:\\n- The increasing tangible book value and invested capital suggest growth and expansion for the company.\\n- The increasing cash and cash equivalents indicate improved liquidity and financial stability.\\n- However, the increasing total debt raises concerns about the company's financial risk and ability to manage its debt obligations. This should be closely monitored.\\n\\nNote: The analysis provided is based on the limited information provided in the balance sheet.
